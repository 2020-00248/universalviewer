Install node (http://nodejs.org)
We are using node for this project as it provides a cross-platform collection of tools with minimal setup overhead.

Install the grunt command line interface globally if you don't already have it:

```$ npm install -g grunt-cli```

Open the console on the player directory.

Install dependencies:

```$ npm install```

Run grunt compile tasks:

```$ grunt```

Run the simple server (on Windows you will need to grant firewall permissions):

```$ node server.js```

Browse to http://localhost:3000
